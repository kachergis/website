abstract: \"Categories carve up the world in a structured way, allowing people to
  inductively reason about the properties of novel exemplars. Children are still in
  the process of learning category structure, and often fail to leverage the inductive
  power of these representations to their advantage. For example, young children generally
  fail to recognize the value of sampling diverse exemplars to support category-wide
  generalization. This study investigates whether teaching children the structure
  within a natural category increases diversity-based inductive reasoning. In an informal
  science learning environment, we presented 259 children aged 5 to 8 years with exemplars
  of the three main types of birds (raptors, songbirds, and waterbirds). After a short
  dialogue pointing out the various within-type similarities and between-type differences,
  children's diversity-based inductive reasoning did not significantly improve, despite
  them evidencing a better understanding of the category's structure. Instead, children
  tended to avoid sampling waterbirds, the least typical cluster of birds. These patterns
  suggest that children's neglect of sample diversity is unlikely to be solely due
  to their relative ignorance of category structure.\"
