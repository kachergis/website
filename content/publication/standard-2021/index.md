abstract: A standard model is a theoretical framework that synthesizes observables
  into a quantitative consensus. Have researchers made progress toward this kind of
  synthesis for childrenâ€™s early language learning? Many computational models of early
  vocabulary learning assume that individual words are learned through an accumulation
  of environmental input. This assumption is also implicit in empirical work that
  emphasizes links between language input and learning outcomes. However, models have
  typically focused on average performance, whereas empirical work has focused on
  variability. To model individual variability, we relate the tradition of research
  on accumulator models to item response theory models from psychometrics. This formal
  connection reveals that currently available data sets do not allow researchers to
  test the resulting models fully, illustrating a critical need for theory to contribute
  to shaping new data collection and creating and testing an eventual standard model.
