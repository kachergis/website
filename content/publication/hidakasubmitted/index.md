abstract: Children learn thousands of words in the first several years of life, inspiring
  many theoretical and empirical studies seeking to understand the speed of word learning.
  The present study revisits recent theoretical analyses of simple sampling models
  with uniformly-distributed word frequency, and considers a more realistic Zipfian
  (i.e., power-law) distribution of words and referents. Our new mathematical analysis
  finds that simple sampling models are unable to account for word learning in feasible
  time under Zipf-distributed word and referent frequencies. To salvage learning under
  realistic distributional assumptions, we propose an active learning model which
  assumes that learners and/or caregivers select (or construct) the contexts from
  which words are sampled. Using simulations and mathematical analysis, we show that
  active learners choosing optimal learning situations learn hundreds of times faster
  than passive learners faced with randomly-sampled situations. Thus, as suggested
  by past empirical studies, we find theoretical support for the idea that statistical
  structure in real-world situations--potentially created by the self-directed learner
  or beneficent teachers--is a potential remedy for the difficulty of learning a Zipf-distributed
  vocabulary.
