abstract: "How can people communicate successfully when they perceive the world differently (asymmetry) and when words can mean different things (ambiguity)? Prior work has appealed to contextual information to blunt the impact of ambiguity, and explicit feedback to resolve misunderstandings caused by asymmetry. Using cognitive agent-based simulations we demonstrate that even without contextual scaffolding and before resorting to interactive feedback, communicators using pragmatic inference can actually exploit ambiguity to overcome asymmetry in mental representations. While intuition suggests that ambiguity only aggravates asymmetry, our formal analyses show that pragmatic communicators have a ‘helping hand’: They can use ambiguity to trade computationally leaner pragmatic inference for costly interactional turbulence. This novel theoretical approach to a longstanding linguistic problem establishes a new paradigm for explaining natural language use."
