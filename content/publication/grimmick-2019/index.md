abstract: "One powerful way children can learn word meanings is via cross-situational\
  \ learning, the ability to discern consistent word-referent mappings from a series\
  \ of ambiguous scenes and utterances. Various computational accounts of word learning\
  \ have been proposed, with mechanisms ranging from storing and testing a single\
  \ hypothesized referent for each word, to tracking multiple graded associations\
  \ and selectively strengthening some of them. Nearly all word learning models assume\
  \ storage of some feasible word-referent mappings from each situation, resulting\
  \ in a degree of learning proportional to the number of co-occurrences. While these\
  \ accumulative models would generally predict that incorrect co-occurrences would\
  \ slow learning, recent empirical work suggests these accounts are incomplete: paradoxically,\
  \ giving learners incorrect mappings early in training was found to boost performance\
  \ (Fitneva and Christiansen, 2015).  We test this finding's generality in a new\
  \ experiment with more items, consider system- and item-level explanations, and\
  \ find that a model with error-driven learning best accounts for this benefit of\
  \ initially-inaccurate pairings."
